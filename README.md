## Project Description :

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, which causes lesions on the retina that affect vision. If it is not detected early, it can lead to blindness. Unfortunately, DR is not a reversible process, and treatment only sustains vision. DR early detection and treatment can significantly reduce the risk of vision loss. The manual diagnosis process of DR retina fundus images by ophthalmologists is time, effort and cost-consuming and prone to misdiagnosis unlike computer-aided diagnosis systems. 


Transfer learning has become one of the most common techniques that has achieved better performance in many areas, especially in medical image analysis and classification. We used Transfer Learning techniques like Inception V3,Resnet50,Xception V3 that are more widely used as a transfer learning method in medical image analysis and they are highly effective.



# OBJECTIVE :

- To Gain a good understanding of the image data.

- To Know fundamental concepts & techniques of transfer learning like Xception, CNN etc..

- To Know how to pre-process and clean the data using different data pre-processing techniques.

- To Know how to build a web application using the Flask framework from python .

## Pre Requisites :
Install the following python packages
  * pip install numpy
  * pip install pandas
  * pip install tensorflow==2.3.2
  * pip install keras==2.3.1
  * pip install Flask

## Prior Knowledge :
You must have prior knowledge of following topics to complete this project.
  * Deep Learning Concepts 
  * CNN
  * VGG16
  * ResNet-50
  * Inception-V3
  * Xception
  * Flask :- 
    *  *Flask is a popular Python web framework, meaning it is a third-party Python library used for developing web applications.*

# PROJECT FLOW :

- The user interacts with the UI (User Interface) to choose the image.

- The chosen image analyzed by the model which is integrated with flask application.

- The Xception Model analyzes the image, then the prediction is showcased on the Flask UI.
